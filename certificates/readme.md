## 1. Python 

I have done certification courses to Learn Python from ``UDEMY``

1. [Complete Python Bootcamp from Zero to hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) :
    This course covers python from very basic to medium level in very good and effective explanation of every module


2. [Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/):
    I found this course very helpfull in understanding Python for Machine learning. This Course covers very important Python Libraries for Machine Learning and Data Science like: pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn and many Machine Learning Algorithms are Explained in Very easy effective way.
    
3. [Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews!](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/):
    This course covers advance use of Python and Data Structures and the kind of Problems are asked in interviews releated to DS and Algo.
    
## 2. Julia

1. [Julia Programming For Data Science & Machine Learning: Julia](https://www.udemy.com/course/julialang/):
    This course is tought by Ankit Mistry and He explained the importance of Julia language and advantage of Julia over othe languages and how this language may take very important place in field of Data Science.
