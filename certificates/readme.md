## Machine & Deep Learning

I'm always keen to learn something new and update my knowledge base and I've taken several ML & DL courses.

The majority are part of specializations by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai).

1. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/)


2. [TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.deeplearning.ai/tensorflow-in-practice/)


3. [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)
